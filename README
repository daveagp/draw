This is a user-friendly C++ drawing library.
It requires that you have Qt4 installed, since that is its backend.

Once downloaded, run "make draw.o" to create the library. 
Then, use it with draw.h to create drawing programs. There are several
examples included in this repository.

See draw.h for an API listing & an explanation of what each function does.

There is experimental audio support. To see how to enable it, read 
the Makefile.

This library is inspired by StdDraw.java by Bob Sedgewick & Kevin Wayne:
